## **Introduction**

Hello, and welcome to my code blog! I started this website as a way for
me to share my coding work publicly. It took a lot of time and messy C#
code to get here, and I could not be more excited. Now, letâ€™s get into
palindromes!

<br />

A common coding interview task is to write code that tells you whether a
given string is a palindrome. It is easy to see why: it is a great way
to showcase knowledge of regular expressions and reshaping data.
Additionally, I think itâ€™s a great time to introduce the idea of
[testing](https://r-pkgs.org/testing-basics.html) in R.

<br />

## **Testing**

One of my biggest pet peeves in coding is when people use cross-tabs,
print statements, and other output in the middle of their scripts to
spot check their results. Good code is consistent and accurate. It is
written in a logical fashion and tells a story. Please stop giving me
research assignments in the middle of your code! If you feel the need to
check the results at each run, thatâ€™s a good sign the code is not ready
yet. This is where formal testing comes into play. Take those spot
checks you were previously doing, automate them, and store them in a
unit test. Then, if new code is added, you can quickly re-run all of
those checks again. It will change your life! In this post, we will be
using [testthat](https://testthat.r-lib.org/) to implement our unit
testing. testthat is mostly built for package development, but now is a
good time to introduce it. Plus, it has some features built in to make
unit testing a little more fun.

<br />

## **Palindromes: Setting up tests**

Next, letâ€™s set up our test cases. Some Googling brought me to
[palindromelist.net](http://www.palindromelist.net/). I noticed that
punctuation and capitalization are disregarded in these lists. For this
blog, I will assume that only the letters of the alphabet matter in
determining whether or not a word is a palindrome. Letâ€™s use a sample of
entries from the website to test our palindrome function. We also want
to make sure the function correctly identifies words that are NOT
palindromes, so letâ€™s add in a test for words that should return FALSE.
Finally, if the supplied value is not a character vector, an error
should be returned.

<br />

``` r
library(testthat)

# Start with writing unit tests!
run_tests <- function(myfun) {
  # These should all return TRUE
  test_that('Works on real palindromes', { # If a test fails, this prints
    palindromes <- c('kayak', 'deified', 'rotator', 'repaper', 'deed', 'peep', 
                     'wow', 'noon', 'civic', 'racecar', 'level', 'mom', 
                     'bird rib', 'taco cat', 'UFO tofu', 'Borrow or rob?', 
                     'Never odd or even.', 'We panic in a pew.', 
                     'Wonâ€™t lovers revolt now?',  
                     'Ma is a nun, as I am.', 'Donâ€™t nod.', 
                     'Sir, I demand, I am a maid named Iris.', 
                     'Was it a car or a cat I saw?', 'Yo, Banana Boy!', 
                     'Eva, can I see bees in a cave?', 
                     'Madam, in Eden, Iâ€™m Adam.', 
                     'A man, a plan, a canal, Panama!', 
                     'Never a foot too far, even.',
                     'Red roses run no risk, sir, on Nurseâ€™s order.', 
                     'He lived as a devil, eh?', 'Ned, I am a maiden.', 
                     'Now, sir, a war is won!', 'Evade me, Dave!', 
                     'Dennis and Edna sinned.', 'Step on no pets!', 'Ã¤Ã¤')
    funx <- myfun
    expect_equal(myfun(palindromes), rep(TRUE, length(palindromes)))
  })
  
  # Ensure it returns False when it should
  test_that('Works on non-palindromes', {
    antipalindromes <- c('cat', 'dog', 'Mustard', '', character(0))
    expect_equal(myfun(antipalindromes), rep(FALSE, length(antipalindromes)))
  })
  
  # Make sure error is thrown if non-character used
  test_that('Error if not character', {
    expect_error(myfun(12))
    expect_error(myfun(NULL))
    expect_error(myfun(FALSE))
    expect_error(myfun(Sys.Date()))
  })
}
```

<br />

Note the function names that read like English. Itâ€™s one of the many
nice things about the testthat package. Typically, in package
development, you would store all of your tests in the
`mypackage/tests/testthat` directory. Above, we placed all unit tests in
a single `run_tests()` function. This is for convenience and to allow
testing and function writing to happen in a single script.

<br />

Before we move on to writing a function, letâ€™s take a step back and
think about all of the benefits of writing these tests. The simple act
of gathering some test cases made us think about the things that make
this â€˜easyâ€™ task hard: capitalization, spaces, punctuation, and empty
strings to name a few. I will confess, my first version of this function
would have failed on 3 out of the 4 pitfalls I just mentioned. Iâ€™m glad
I finally took the time to step back and write good tests!

<br />

## **Function is_palindrome**

<br />

``` r
# Write a function to determine whether a particular word is a palindrome
is_palindrome <- function(word){
  # Check that a character input was provided
  if(!is.character(word)){
    stop('That is not valid input. Please try again.')
  }
  
  # Strip out non-alpha characters, convert to lower case, check equivalency
  newword <- tolower(gsub('\\W', '', word))
  rev_words <- do.call(c, 
                       lapply(newword, 
                              function(x) {
                                paste(rev(strsplit(x, NULL)[[1]]), 
                                      collapse = '')
                                }
                              ))
  out <- tolower(newword) == tolower(rev_words)
  out[which(newword == '')] <- FALSE
  return(out)
}


# Try it out on a few samples
is_palindrome(c('Jon', 'apple', 'sos'))
```

    ## [1] FALSE FALSE  TRUE

``` r
# And run our comprehensive testing function from above!
run_tests(is_palindrome)
```

    ## Test passed ðŸ¥‡
    ## Test passed ðŸŽŠ
    ## Test passed ðŸ˜¸

<br />

And there you have it! A vectorized, flexible function to identify
palindromes, all ready to go. Well, almostâ€¦we forgot about characters
not in the English alphabet! I wonâ€™t pretend to know any foreign
languages (Iâ€™m barely literate in English and R), but it would at least
be nice for it to work in other languages in theory. Perhaps a new test
might look something like:

<br />

``` r
# A lazy example, I will admit
library(waldo) # For foreign characters
test_that('Non-english characters are okay',
          expect_true(is_palindrome('Ã¤Ã¤')))
```

    ## Test passed ðŸ¥³
