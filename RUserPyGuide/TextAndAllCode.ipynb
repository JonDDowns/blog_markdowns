    "## An R User's Guide to Python, Part I\n",
    "\n",
    "In this series, I will be demonstrating a few common tasks in both R and Python. The goal is to demonstrate just how similar these languages can be while showing some of the basics.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Coding has come a long way in my field in a short amount of time. As recently as 5 years ago, most analysis was done in SAS. R was for the most advanced of analysts. Later, R began growing rapidly as the prospect of job automation took hold. Now, more Python users are coming into the fold, and the great \"R vs. Python\" debate has begun. Similar [click-bait hot takes](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/alex-freberg_python-is-better-than-r-activity-6752637240578600960-a36V/?trk=public_profile_like_view&originalSubdomain=ke) abound on the web. Which is to be expected, I suppose. Data scientists have a reputation for having opinions (and the close relatives '...opinions' and 'opinions...').\n",

    "#### A summary of the R vs. Python Debate\n",
    "\n",
    "There is no shortage of posts about this topic, so I will keep it short. The Python folks argue that [Python is the most popular coding language](https://pypl.github.io/PYPL.html). The sheer size of the community means that it will always be able to do more. R is fussy and esoteric, they say.\n",
    "\n",
    "The R side points out that R packages, especially those used in modeling, are often maintained by the top experts in their respective fields ([survival analysis](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/survival/index.html), [Generalized Additive Models](https://www.taylorfrancis.com/books/mono/10.1201/9781315370279/generalized-additive-models-simon-wood), and [Epidemiological Network models](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/EpiModel/index.html), to name a few). Additionally, the [Journal of Statistical Software](https://www.jstatsoft.org/index) is an academic publication that introduces and explains software implementations of new statistical methods, and R is the most common choice.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why the Debate Misses the Point\n",
    "\n",
    "The R vs. Python debate is largely counterproductive because it places the focus on the language instead of the analyst. The biggest risk to your data science career is not \"choosing the wrong language\", it is stubbornly choosing to work with only one language. Some of the oldest programming languages, COBOL and FORTRAN, are [highly desired in the financial sector](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/06/technology/cobol-jobs.html) precisely because they perform critical roles in the financial code base whilst being known by very few people. Speaking of FORTRAN, it is still used in both [R](https://www.r-bloggers.com/2014/04/fortran-and-r-speed-things-up/) and [Python](https://fortranwiki.org/fortran/show/Python). And let's not forget about [Julia](https://julialang.org/), a relatively new language that runs blazingly fast compared to both R and Python. Stick to one language at your own peril.\n",
    "\n",
    "I am reminded of a story from my own life. Early in the COVID-19 pandemic, my wife and I got really into cycling. After consistent improvement early on, I hit a plateau and I wanted to upgrade my mountain bike for a $3,000 road bike. The road bike was perfectly engineered for the task: 11 pounds lighter with thinner tires to reduce friction. But, I soon realized something: if I rode my bike more and stopped drinking beers after the weekend rides, I would lose that same 11 pounds and then some. The bike would have provided a mild, one-time boost, at best.\n",

    "### Common Data Science Tasks in R and Python\n",
    "\n",
    "I will let you in on a little secret: R and Python look pretty darn similar for many data science tasks. To show you just how similar they can be, this blog post will walk through how both R and Python: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Install and load special modules and packages developed by the community\n",
    "2. Work with the filesystem and system commands\n",
    "3. Connect to SQL databases and extract data\n",
    "4. Basic data exploration: understand what kinds of data you have and how many records there are\n",
    "5. Subsetting data: keep only what you need and get rid of everything else\n",
    "\n",
    "Future posts will cover other topics, such as data aggregation and/or data visualization. For some of the database tasks, I will connect to a SQL server instance I stood up on a personal cloud account. If you would like to stand up your own version, Microsoft has a tutorial [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/samples/adventureworks-install-configure?view=sql-server-ver16&tabs=ssms#deploy-to-azure-sql-database).\n",

    "#### Modules and Packages: Install, Load, Use\n",
    "\n",
    "Really, there are three notable differences here:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Python calls them \"Modules\", and R calls them \"Packages\"\n",
    "2. R packages are installed in an R session while Python modules are installed from the shell\n",
    "3. As long as an R package has been installed, it can be called using the pkg::function() syntax. Python modules must always be loaded before use.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Python\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, pip is the base package installer, but other options (like [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/)) exist. In either case, the syntax in similar:"
